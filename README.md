# The Towers
Minecraft plugin for Spigot/Bukkit servers, for "The Towers" map made by Quijx

## How to set up
- Download the map [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/ck88ii1tzh25uv6/TowersTemplate.zip) (modified version of the original map).
- Extract it, you should get a ``TowersTemplate`` folder.
- Put that folder at your server's root folder (where the file to launch it is located).
- Make sure that the map's name is ``TowersTemplate``.
- Edit your ``server.properties`` file. Set ``level-name`` to ``currentGame``.
- Launch the server and execute ``/newgame`` in the chat.
- Join your team and start playing!

### Make sure you run ``/newgame`` every time you start the server!

## Commands
- ``/ping`` : returns "Pong!". Nothing useful.
- ``/newgame`` : resets the server's map to start a new game.
- ``/leaveobservers`` : run this comoand to leave the observers team.
